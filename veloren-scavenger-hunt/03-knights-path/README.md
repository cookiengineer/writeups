# Part 3: Knight's Path

The knight's path puzzle was a little trickster puzzle, because I initially thought it would use
vigenere with excluded . and / characters for a URL due to the alphabet needing custom characters
then.

But as it turns out, it was quite easy. It was helpful to mark the paths to find out that the Knight
didn't start at `K` but at `P` (the only field where a Knight in Chess usually stands initially).

That lead to recognizing `pastebin` and the `pastebin / Asu0Kyth` strings.

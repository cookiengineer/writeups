There's an alchemist babbling in mathematical formulas that seemingly don't make sense.
But it seems as those equation results are either the result of a wrong `base` or wrong `bit length`
that was being used, and the carry bit might be overflowing.

```
48 - 7  = 146
4  + 8  = 131
14 + 5  = 122
4  + 15 = 136
2  x 2  = 118
10 x 9  = 171
13 + 4  = 85
8  + 14 = 77
54 - 14 = 116
7  x 6  = 150
```
